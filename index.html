            <h1>Colin Barnett uncut</h1>
            <p class="subhead">Success, defeat, regrets and his lasting legacy</p>
            <p class="byline">By Ben Harvey</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p><strong>Arrogant <em>adjective</em> 1. Making unwarrantable claims or pretensions to superior importance or rights; overbearingly assuming; insolently proud.</strong></p>
            <p>By the Macquarie Dictionary&rsquo;s strict definition, Colin Barnett isn&rsquo;t arrogant. Yep, we were wrong this whole time.</p>
            <p>Sure, he has pretensions to &ldquo;superior importance&rdquo; but even a cursory glance at his career shows those pretensions are not &ldquo;unwarrantable&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>Let's start at the beginning.</p>
            <p>He beat a formidable field in a 1990 by-election to become the Liberal member for Cottesloe. He won the seat again in 1993 and went straight into Richard Court's first Cabinet.</p>
            <p>He was leader or deputy leader of the Liberal Party for 22 of his 27 years in politics and leader or deputy leader in every election since 1993.</p>
             <p>As well as being Leader of the House in the Legislative Assembly through the 1990s he held at the same time three heavyweight portfolios: resources development, education and energy.</p>
            <p>In that period he oversaw some of the most complicated reforms and deals in WA&rsquo;s history, any one of which would have been a career-defining achievement for most politicians.</p>
            <div class="picture">
                    <img src="images/howard.jpg" alt="Colin Barnett with PM John Howard.">
                    <figcaption>Colin Barnett with PM John Howard.</figcaption>
                </div>
            <p>He built the long-talked about but never realised Collie power station. He built the Goldfields Gas Pipeline. He successfully privatised Alinta Gas and the Dampier-to-Bunbury gas pipeline. He renegotiated a sprawling array of contracts with the oil majors which owned the North West Shelf. He opened the Onslow salt project.</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s pause there and consider that we are not even halfway through his career and are yet to talk about the universal pre-primary and kindergarten programs of which he was architect.</p>
            <p>Barnett has the runs on the board. He doesn&rsquo;t meet the criteria to be arrogant. So what is he?</p>
            <p><strong>Cocksure <em>adjective</em> 1. perfectly certain; completely confident in one's own mind.</strong> </p>
            <p>That's a more accurate description. And it&rsquo;s one that Barnett doesn&rsquo;t shy away from. Actually, this guy runs towards it.</p>
            <p>"I always believed I would succeed. And I believed I&rsquo;d probably end up getting to be premier. If I am honest, when I decided to go into politics, and that was when I was running the Chamber of Commerce and I was in my late 30s ... I did believe I would probably become premier."</p>

                    <p>At one stage I went into the party room and said ‘I just want to make it clear that I do not have cancer, I have not had a heart attack, I haven’t had a stroke and I haven’t got AIDS’.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Troy Buswell</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p> He was clearly one of the most talented politicians I had ever seen. But he was flawed. People think that because he had an affair with Adele Carles that’s why I sacked him.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Losing office</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Losing an election is incredibly humiliating because you are such a public figure. I think the saving grace for me, to some extent, was that I was 67, or heading that way.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>If I had perfect hindsight at the time we probably didn’t need to go as hard on public spending if I knew there was going to be a surge in the resources industry.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Mark McGowan</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>I wrote a little note to McGowan and my advice to him was you have to make decisions and back your own judgment. Back yourself in.</p>
                </div>
            </aside>
            <p>This at-times breathtaking self-assuredness is a recurring theme in the two-and-a-half hours he spoke to&nbsp;<em>WestBusiness Insider&nbsp;</em>in his first major interview since losing the State election in March.</p>
            <p>Barnett is utterly certain that he was the only person capable of stitching together a deal as politically and economically complicated as the renegotiation of iron ore royalties with BHP and Rio Tinto or gas contracts with the North West Shelf.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone else could have done it,&rdquo; he says, matter-of-factly. &ldquo;In my own mind I had a good track record going way back to the Collie power station, which had been argued about for 12 years, was the first thing I cracked as minister in the 1990s. And then the Goldfields gas pipeline and even more recently renegotiating iron ore royalties.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;With due respect to Geoff (Gallop), I don&rsquo;t think he would have been able to do any of those things. He wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to get the big projects under way. I just don&rsquo;t think he would have had the ability to do that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Most political observers believe, perhaps not as strongly as Barnett does, that the Member for Cottesloe mopped the floor with his contemporaries when it came to getting big projects up and running.</p>
            <p>But that counted for little in Opposition.</p>
            <p>Sidelined by Richard Court in favour of Julie Bishop in the bloody aftermath of the Liberal Party&rsquo;s loss to Labor in 2001, Barnett had a miserable time on the other side of the chamber, culminating in his loss to Geoff Gallop in 2005.</p>
            <p>A bizarre set of circumstances involving Troy Buswell and a poor decision by Alan Carpenter to call a snap election saw Barnett wipe out Labor&rsquo;s 17-seat majority on September 6, 2008.</p>

            <p>Then followed a period in purgatory, not celebration, as for a torturous week the young buck in charge of the WA National Party, Brendon Grylls, played Labor off against Liberals to win his favour and therefore the balance of power.</p>
            <p>Grylls sided with the Liberals and, after surviving against ever-increasing odds, Barnett would be confirmed as premier.</p>
            <p>Then followed a period in purgatory, not celebration, as for a torturous week the young buck in charge of the WA National Party, Brendon Grylls, played Labor off against Liberals to win his favour and therefore the balance of power.</p>
            <p>Grylls sided with the Liberals and, after surviving against ever-increasing odds, Barnett would be confirmed as premier.</p>
            <p>Finally, he could start rebuilding the State in the shape he wanted. Blessed with a strong local economy, little debt and a healthy State balance sheet, Barnett was ready to make his mark.</p>
            <p>It was September 14, 2008.</p>
            <p>One day later, Lehman Brothers collapsed.</p>
            <h2>Prepare for impact</h2>
            <p>&ldquo;I had some internal panic,&rdquo; Barnett says as he recalls the early days of the global financial crisis. An economist by trade, he was acutely aware that WA would be hit hard.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Most exporters export their marginal production. They only export their surplus. Here, it&rsquo;s our dominant industry,&rdquo; he says.</p>
            <p>Business went back into its shell as the financial structures that had governed the world economy since World War II collapsed.</p>
            <div class="quote">I could see the infrastructure that had gone into Brisbane and it struck me as I was looking out the plane window that Perth had fallen so far behind the other cities of Australia.</div>
            <p>As banks in the US and Europe failed, the global economy plunged into recession. For a period in late 2008 and early 2009, serious thinkers worried that capitalism as we knew it would not survive.</p>
            <p>The former economics lecturer, who for years had taught Keynesian doctrine, was about to turn theory into practice.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;What I set out to do, and this was clear thought, as business curled up into a corner I knew we needed to have a strong capital works program here and I knew I had to do all I could to resurrect some projects and get some investment in our economy. It had just dried up. Everything had stopped.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The first lever he pulled? Chevron&rsquo;s stalled Gorgon LNG project on Barrow Island.</p>
            <p>The old sense of self-confidence that lay dormant for years in Opposition soon came back.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Just after I became leader I had a meeting with Chevron, their leaders from the US were here. It sounds a bit egotistical but it&rsquo;s true, they said &lsquo;who has responsibility for the Gorgon project&rsquo;. And I said I had and they said &lsquo;OK, we&rsquo;ll restart it&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The next lever was the wholesale reconstruction of Perth. His determination was forged when he was returning home from a Council of Australian Governments meeting in Queensland.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Flying out I could see the infrastructure that had gone into Brisbane and it struck me that Perth had fallen so far behind the other cities of Australia.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I came back determined. We had been talking about Elizabeth Quay for ever, we had been talking about sinking the rail line for 100 years, we had been talking about the stadium.&rdquo;</p>
            <h2>Hey, big spender</h2>
            <p>What Barnett didn&rsquo;t know was that while he was pump-priming the WA economy in his own version of Roosevelt&rsquo;s New Deal, the Chinese politburo was signing off on one of the biggest fiscal stimulus packages the world had seen.</p>
            <p>It was a coincidence of intent that created the economic super cycle in WA and saw the expression &ldquo;The Boom&rdquo; enter the local vernacular.</p>
            <p>Over the next six extraordinary years, half a million people arrived in WA as word spread of the modern-day El Dorado which was defying the GFC.</p>
            <p>WA didn&rsquo;t know what hit it and policymakers were hopelessly unprepared. The economy quickly overheated and prices rose uncontrollably as demand outstripped supply everywhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="parallax quay">
            <figcaption>The controversial Elizabeth Quay development.</figcaption>
        </div>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p>Treasury was warning Barnett but the extent of the problem hit home on a site visit to Gorgon.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I ran into the guy in the pub and he came and grizzled about how much tax he was paying. He said he was paying $80,000 in tax. I said &lsquo;what do you do?&rsquo; and he said he was an electrician. When I said &lsquo;what do you get paid&rsquo; he said &lsquo;$250,000&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Barnett is annoyed that critics emboldened by 20:20 hindsight have blasted his capital works program as wasteful.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If I had perfect hindsight at the time we probably didn&rsquo;t need to go as hard on public spending if I knew there was going to be a surge in the resources industry. But at that stage I didn&rsquo;t have a project. I knew that capital spending would be important just to keep the economy going because I could see nothing in the private sector.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated that we would get that surge. I was concentrating on getting Gorgon off the ground. I wouldn&rsquo;t have expected Wheatstone to be right on its tail. During this decade iron ore production doubled and LNG trebled. I couldn&rsquo;t have anticipated that those industries would be successful in such a short period of time.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>In Barnett&rsquo;s mind, the risk of going too hard was outweighed by the risk of missing the (Chinese-made) boat. It&rsquo;s clear when Barnett talks about the importance of WA&rsquo;s trade links with China that the State&rsquo;s 29th premier is confident he will secure a place in history.</p>
            <div class="picture">

                <figcaption>The boom in iron ore prices was both a gift a curse for WA.</figcaption>
            </div>
            <p>&ldquo;The first was the gold rush of the 1890s and you had a strong premier in Forrest who made courageous decisions, with the water pipeline being the obvious one,&rdquo; he says.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The next great period of development was the reconstruction of Japan in the 1960s, and again you had a strong combination of Charles Court identifying the mining industry.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I was very conscious of the emergence of China as the third great economic boost. I felt a responsibility.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t compare myself with Forrest or Court but I was in the same position they were in and they both took risks. Forrest building the (water) pipeline to Kalgoorlie. That was a massive financial risk. Charlie Court building the Dampier (gas) pipeline. That was a massive risk and the bigger risk he took was the take-or-pay contract for the gas from the North West Shelf.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;People talk about the risks I took but they were nowhere near that risk and both of them were pilloried at the time. So I thought, historically I&rsquo;m in good company here. I&rsquo;m doing the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <h2>Stepping into the global spotlight</h2>
            <p>The man in charge of an economic juggernaut, who at one time dreamed about a career playing footy for Claremont, became an unlikely player on the world stage.</p>
            <p>Barnett recounts a tale of a dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping that had been organised by then prime minister Tony Abbott.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The premiers all sort of lined up, like sheep, in order of importance in Australia by population and before the media came in the Chinese came and took me by the shoulders and took me up the front to stand next to Abbott and Xi.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>He remembers another moment when Xi and Abbott were &ldquo;having an animated conversation&rdquo;.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;It was obviously Tony telling Xi about the shark thing. Xi stood up at the table and with the big round face grinning said &lsquo;shark killer, shark killer!&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

            </div>
            <p>A few years later Barnett found himself at Buckingham Palace, acutely aware of his own well-reported pro-republic views as he waited with his wife Lyn for an audience with the Queen.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I just chatted about Perth and CHOGM and this was just after William and Kate were married. The Queen and I were sitting next to each other and Lyn was sitting on a little couch on the other side of the coffee table,&rdquo; he says.</p>
            <p>As &ldquo;the corgies were scratching at the door&rdquo; his quietly spoken wife hijacked the conversation by asking &ldquo;Your Majesty, how was the wedding?&rdquo;.</p>
            <div class="quote">There were these two women taking about a wedding and I thought &lsquo;right, I&rsquo;m out of this conversation&rsquo;</div>
            <p>If I had perfect hindsight at the time we probably didn’t need to go as hard on public spending if I knew there was going to be a surge in the resources industry ... I couldn’t have anticipated that those industries would be successful in such a short period of time.</p>
            <p>His popularity was peaking as he hosted the Queen and Prince Philip when they stayed in Perth for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 2011. It was around that time that iron ore was worth more than $US180 a tonne &mdash; six times its long-term average &mdash; and it looked like nothing would stop the party.</p>
            <p>It would be three hedonistic years before someone killed the music, turned on the lights and ushered in the dawn of an ugly hangover.</p>

            <h2>Hard landing</h2>
            <p>Just as the fly-in, fly-out tradies who hocked themselves to buy jet skis and V8 utes found they had been living in a bubble, so did the Government.</p>
            <p>The numbers were sobering. In 2007-08, WA was running a surplus of $650 million and had net debt of $7 billion. After 10 years of partying, the deficit was $3 billion and net debt was $32.5 billion.</p>
            <p>Barnett admits he spent too much. It&rsquo;s an accusation the state of the Budget makes impossible to deny. But he is comfortable, maybe a little imperious, justifying the bill.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;At that GFC time I thought it was a matter of saving the house,&rdquo; he says.</p>
            <p>Sitting in his electorate office and removed from the political cut and thrust, he calmly identifies three underlying causes of the debt problem.</p>
            <p>The first is all about political-economy.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If iron ore had stayed around $US90 a tonne we would have been OK, we might have had a small deficit, or if the GST had stayed even above 50&cent; in the dollar, but when it went to 30&cent; we had a perfect storm.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Barnett is adamant this was an inescapable conclusion, regardless of who was premier.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;There was no circumstance that I had or McGowan has got now where there isn&rsquo;t going to be significant deficit and therefore there&rsquo;s going to be a rise in debt.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The second problem was failing to recognise, despite warnings from Treasury, that the simplicity of Royalties for Regions hid a sinister Budget threat.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;As time went on the projects became more marginal. I think that&rsquo;s where it was overly indulgent. That was the problem with the alliance arrangement with the Nats. That was causing a huge rift in government.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The third problem was talent, or lack thereof, on his front bench.</p>
            <div class="quote">If iron ore had stayed around $US90 a tonne we would have been OK, we might have had a small deficit, or if the GST had stayed even above 50¢ in the dollar, but when it went to 30¢ we had a perfect storm.</div>
            <p>For 27 years Barnett has struggled to hide his contempt for underperforming colleagues.</p>
            <p>Eight months after losing the premiership and with retirement beckoning, he no longer tries.</p>
            <p>It&rsquo;s an at-times withering assessment.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;If you look at our first term, things did go well there. As that came to an end we lost Brendon Grylls. Liz Constable decided to go.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Troy had all his problems. He was clearly one of the most talented politicians I had ever seen. But he was flawed. I wasn&rsquo;t aware his health was as serious as it was. And it was serious. As serious as it gets.</p>
            <p>&ldquo; Christian Porter decided to go into Federal politics. Norman Moore, not my closest friend in politics, did a good job as mines minister and a good job in fisheries.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;In that first term I had ministers I could rely on. I didn&rsquo;t need to tell Troy or Brendon twice what I wanted them to do.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;The second-term Cabinet was not as strong as the first. In any Cabinet, whether it be Federal or State, you usually have half a dozen people who are the drivers. And I lost most of the drivers.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I was conscious of the lack of horsepower in Cabinet the second time around. It frustrated me when I had some ministers who were not dealing with what I thought were pretty simple things.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>He used the example of an archaic law that required Cabinet to sign off on appointments to local cemetery boards.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;We were appointing people to be on the Doodlakine cemetery board. I said &lsquo;just hand this over to local government&rsquo; and I had two ministers who could never actually achieve it. I was thinking &lsquo;this has got to be the easiest thing to get rid of&rsquo;. It did impact on my view of those ministers. If you cannot deal with something like cemetery board appointments ...&rdquo;</p>
            <p>By 2015, the wheels were coming off his wagon.</p>
            <p>Every month seemed to bring a calamity: Dean Nalder&rsquo;s leadership challenge (&ldquo;It was damaging&rdquo;); a ham-fisted response to shark attacks (&ldquo;Then there was the shark thing when I held up that bloody hook. I got sucked into that one&rdquo;); the ill-fated One Nation preference deal (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true I never knew about that deal, bizarre as that sounds&rdquo;); junking the MAX light rail plan (&ldquo;Labor was very good on broken promises&rdquo;) and rumours about his health after his dramatic weight loss (&ldquo;At one stage I went into the party room and said &lsquo;I just want to make it clear that I do not have cancer, I have not had a heart attack, I haven&rsquo;t had a stroke and I haven&rsquo;t got AIDS&rsquo;.&rdquo;).</p>
            <p>The 2017 election campaign was a fizzer. Still, Barnett never saw the rout coming.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Losing an election, and particularly a big loss is very humiliating. It probably took me six months to get over it. Jeff Kennett had the same experience. Jeff was a good friend to me. He spoke to me quite often after the election.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>The embarrassment he felt after being turfed out was soon replaced by a new emotion: frustration.</p>
            <p>He is frustrated that he is being lampooned by MPs he knows, on their best day, could not accomplish what he could on his worst. Frustrated at not leaving on his own terms. And frustrated that he may be considered a one-trick pony: a man who will be remembered only as the &ldquo;resources&rdquo; guy.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I reject this idea that I was only about mining and didn&rsquo;t have a vision for the State. I have had a vision for this State since I was first sworn in in 1990.&rdquo;</p>
            <h2>The Barnett legacy</h2>
            <p>It may take some time but history will remember that it was Barnett who negotiated a native title agreement covering Perth and backed that up with a quiet homage to Noongars through Yagan Square.</p>
            <p>His decision to invest heavily in disability services changed more lives with one stroke of a pen than most policies do in years.</p>
            <p>The man once accused of trying to ruin the Kimberley with a gas processing hub created Australia&rsquo;s biggest national park there.</p>

            <p>He allowed independent public schools, introduced GM crops, brought the river to the city at Elizabeth Quay, built a jaw-dropping stadium, rebuilt the State&rsquo;s health infrastructure.</p>
            <p>He has regrets, not least being the state of the books. &ldquo;Yes, there is a legacy and that legacy is debt.&rdquo; A main source of anguish is the debacle over the Perth Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
            <p>His explanation of why that is speaks to a side of the 67-year-old that few appreciate and which he probably hopes history may one day recognise: Barnett is actually a bit of a softy.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I was very conscious out of that boom period there had to be some tangible benefits. The children&rsquo;s hospital for me was the number one thing.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;By delaying the stadium, by doing the deal with BHP and Rio to put $350 million straight into it ... I thought I had done a very tangible thing. If a government can produce something for a community I can&rsquo;t think of anything better than a children&rsquo;s hospital. I would have loved to have been there when (it) was finished.&rdquo;</p>
            <div class="quote">If a government can produce something for a community I can’t think of anything better than a children’s hospital. I would have loved to have been there when (it) was finished.</div>
            <p>As for his place in history, it will take political scientists time to determine whether Barnett ranks alongside Charles Court and John Forrest.</p>
            <p>Barnett hopes that if the historical record is not kind, it will at least be complete.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I think when people look back they will see this decade ... as the third great period of our development.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;They might give a little bit of credit to me but a lot of other people did other things. I hope it will also be seen as a period of social and environmental advancement.&rdquo;</p>
